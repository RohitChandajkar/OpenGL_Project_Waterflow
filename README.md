# Waterflow Path Visualization with C++ and OpenGL

This project showcases waterflow paths on a terrain represented by an STL file using C++ and OpenGL.

## Overview

The project aims to visualize how water would flow across a 3D terrain. By loading a terrain model from an STL file, it simulates the path water would take under different conditions.

## Features

- **STL File Support:** Load terrain data from STL files.
- **Waterflow Simulation:** Simulate waterflow on the terrain.
- **OpenGL Rendering:** Render the terrain and waterflow paths in real-time.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/waterflow-visualization.git
    ```

2. **Compile the Source Code:**
    Use a C++ compiler to compile the code.

3. **Run the Executable:**
    Run the generated executable.

4. **Load an STL File:**
    Choose an STL file containing the terrain data.

5. **Adjust Simulation Parameters:**
    Modify parameters like precipitation rate to see different waterflow patterns.

6. **Visualize Waterflow Paths:**
    Explore the rendered terrain and observe how water would flow.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler with C++17 support
- OpenGL (3.3 or higher)
- GLFW (OpenGL Framework)
- GLM (OpenGL Mathematics)
- Assimp (Open Asset Import Library for loading STL files)
